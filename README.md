# Easily plot data from WandB directly to matplotlib

## Usage
You need to define the layout of your matplotlib plot as usual, i.e. create subfigures etc.
You can then pass the axes objects of that plot to wandb_plot, to plot the desired data from WandB directly onto that axis.

Minimal Example:
```

```

## Installation
Optionally: Setup a conda environment first
```
git clone git@github.com:danielpalen/wandb_plot.git
cd wandb_plot
pip install .
```
